## Decay Chains

One might think these must be disgusting and smelly bands of metal that demented people put on their neck but alas, if only humans were that fun.
Anyways, the project is actually some JavaScript and HTML I mashed together in order to create a tool that showcases the Porbability and Chain reactions of Radioactive Decay.
I was inspired by a [NileRed satirical video](https://youtu.be/Gbgk8d3Y1Q4?si=Bg-MuNg7WdOOJ75N) video on Youtube

This repository contains the core components of the project focused on predicting loan defaulters using historical lending data.

##  Repository Contents


- `App/` — Contains the main Javascript and html files and a backup one.
- `DOCUMENTATION/` — These are Initial Project Files that are only help in looking at the progress of this project.
- `Archive/` — Contains Archived project files that are either unstable or completely unusable.

##  Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML and CSS (Tailwind and Bootstrap)
  
##  Project Highlights
- Javascript workflow
- Modular and reproducible code
- Deployed solution demonstrating practical application

##  Deployment

A live version of the project will soon be available [here](). 

##  Additional Notes

This repository is intended to showcase the probability of decay of radioactive isotopes
