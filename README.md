## Decay Chains

One might think these must be green, disgusting and smelly bands of iron that demented people put on their necks but alas, if only humans were that fun.

Anyways, the project is actually some JavaScript and HTML I mashed together in order to create a tool that showcases the Probability and Chain reactions of Radioactive Decay.

I was inspired by [NileRed](https://youtu.be/Gbgk8d3Y1Q4?si=Bg-MuNg7WdOOJ75) on Youtube that made me kinda interested in Nuclear Physics.


##  Repository Contents


- `App/` — Contains the main Javascript and html files and a backup one.
- `DOCUMENTATION/` — These are Initial Project Files that are only help in looking at the progress of this project.
- `Archive/` — Contains Archived project files that are either unstable or completely unusable.

##  Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML and CSS (Tailwind and Bootstrap)
  
##  Project Highlights
- Javascript workflow
- Modular and reproducible code
- Deployed solution demonstrating practical application

##  Deployment

A live version of the project will soon be available [here](https://burhan077.github.io/decay.github.io/). 

##  Additional Notes

This repository is intended to showcase the probability of decay of radioactive isotopes
